=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::Tempdir - Shell Out and collect the result in a DZ plug-in.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package #
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FooBar;

  use Moose;
  with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Tempdir';
  with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::FileInjector';
  with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::InstallTool';

  sub setup_installer {
    my ( $self, $arg ) = @_ ;

    my ( @generated_files ) = $self->capture_tempdir(sub{
      system( $somecommand );
    });

    for ( @generated_files ) {
      if( $_->is_new && $_->name =~ qr/someregex/ ){
        $self->add_file( $_->file );
      }
    }
  }

This role is a convenience role for factoring into other plug-ins to use the power of Unix
in any plug-in.

If for whatever reason you need to shell out and run your own app that is not Perl ( i.e.: Java )
to go through the code and make modifications, produce documentation, etc, then this role is for you.

Important to note however, this role B<ONLY> deals with getting C<Dist::Zilla>'s state written out to disk,
executing your given arbitrary code, and then collecting the results. At no point does it attempt to re-inject
those changes back into L<< C<Dist::Zilla>|Dist::Zilla >>. That is left as an exercise to the plug-in developer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 capture_tempdir

Creates a temporary and dumps the current state of Dist::Zilla's files into it.

Runs the specified code sub C<chdir>'ed into that C<tmpdir>, and captures the changed files.

  my ( @array ) = $self->capture_tempdir(sub{

  });

Response is an array of L<< C<::Tempdir::Item>|Dist::Zilla::Tempdir::Item >>

   [ bless( { name => 'file/Name/Here' ,
      status => 'O' # O = Original, N = New, M = Modified, D = Deleted
      file   => Dist::Zilla::Role::File object
    }, 'Dist::Zilla::Tempdir::Item' ) , bless ( ... ) ..... ]

Make sure to look at L<< C<Dist::Zilla::Tempdir::Item>|Dist::Zilla::Tempdir::Item >> for usage.
