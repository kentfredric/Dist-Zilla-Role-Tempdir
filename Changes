 [00 Major]
 - ::Dir has new 'keepalive' method to mark/unmark scratch dirs for destruction.
 - ::Dir nas new 'keepalive_fail' method to trigger a croak, keep the temporary directory, and tell the user where to
   find it.
 - ::Dir::run_in()  and thus, ::Role::Tempdir::capture_tempdir(), now pass the Dir object itself as $_[0] for easy
   access.
 - ::Dir now generates tempdirs with the prefix "DZ_R_Tempdir_" for easy cleanup if tempdirs are left around.
 - ::Dir now supports property '_tempdir_owner' which will be normalised and included in the tempdir prefix if
   specified.
 - ::Role::Tempdir::capture_tempdir) now automatically passes the name of the consuming plugin as "_tempdir_owner",
   giving consuming plugins clear tempdir locations when things fail.

 [00 Major]
 - DZil Encoding support added.

 [01 Minor backwards incompatible API change]
 - Accessing $item->{name} is now gone entirely, use $item->name instead.
 - $item->{state} may also vanish in the near future, stop using it.

 [02 Dzil Encoding Support]
 - Should now be compatible with DZil 5, and reading files from a tempdir will now default to reading their content as
   "encoded_content" to an InMemory object.

 [03 Path/IO Replaced]
 - Usage of Path::Class and File::Slurp have both been eliminated and replaced by Path::Tiny
 - File::Find::Rule is replaced with Path::Iterator::Rule
 - File::Tempdir usage eliminated in favour of custom + Path::Tiny

 - Toolkit upgrade dependencies now prefer "latest" via "recommends", instead of "requires"

 - Version semantics are now X.YYYZZZ
 - This is the primary motivation for the 1.x on the box.
